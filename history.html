</UL>
<h2>1.4/SSL (23-Nov-1999)</h2>
<UL>
<LI>TinySSL is shipped again with 0.8.1 SSLeay DLLs as testing has shown them as most stable, though they were vulnerable to PKCS#1 padding attack. See <A HREF="http://www.openssl.org">www.openssl.org</A> for the developed versions of SSLeay library.</LI>
</UL>
<h2>1.8 (14 January 2000)</h2>

<h2>1.94 (06 April 2017)</h2>
<UL>
<LI>Added an additional check that the requested file name is safe (see LocalFNameSafe and FileIsRegular): that the file is a normal file rather than a device name, that the file is kept in a directory that does not have hidden or system attribute.</LI>
<LI>When the sever wants to close the connection due to an error and the client did send the "Connection: Keep-Alive request" header, some clients thought that the connection should continue despite the server didn't send the "Connection: Keep-Alive" response header. Now, in these cases, the server explicitly send the "Connection: Close" response header.</LI>
