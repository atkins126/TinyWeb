<td>TinyWeb is intended to be a simple Win32 daemon for regular (TCP/http) and secure (<a href="#TinySSL">SSL</a>/https) web servers. TinyWeb is written by Max Masyutin (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/mailto:max@ritlabs.com">max@ritlabs.com</a>) using Delphi. Source code is also provided.</td>

<p>This program is FREE for commercial and non-commercial use. The only restriction is that copyright holder must be attributed with the development of this code. See the <a href="/web/19981205052436/http://www.ritlabs.com/ftp/pub/tinyweb/licence.txt">LICENCE</a> file for more details. Well, as this has been in essence an unpaid effort there is no guarantee of support (you get what you pay for :-), however I do undertake a limited amount of consulting.
<p>This program may be freely distributed, provided the distribution package is not modified. No person or company may charge a fee for the distribution of this program without written permission of the copyright holder.
<p>TinyWeb is extremely small (executable file size is 34K), simple (no any configuration except command line) and fast (consumes as little system memory and CPU resources as possible). TinyWeb installs in minutes and maintains a low-memory profile.
<p>TinyWeb has got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://hotfiles.zdnet.com/cgi-bin/texis/swlib/hotfiles/info.html?fcode=000MQL">five-star rating at ZDNet HotFiles</a> <img src="/web/19981205052436im_/http://www.ritlabs.com/zd5star.gif" width="58" height="10" alt="">

<h2><a name="Installing">Installing</a></h2>
To install TinyWeb server just create a shortcut in Startup menu with the following properties:
<table>
<tr><td>Target<td><b><tt>c:\www\bin\tiny.exe c:\www\root</tt></b>
<tr><td>Start In<td><b><tt>c:\www\log</tt></b>
</table>
<b><tt>c:\www\bin\tiny.exe</tt></b> is the path to TinyWeb executable, <b><tt>c:\www\root</tt></b> is the path to www home (root) directory, and <b><tt>c:\www\log</tt></b> is the directory for log files TinyWeb keeps.

<p>TinyWeb is neither windowed nor console application, moreover, it is not a Windows Service. Once started, <code>tiny.exe</code> will appear in Task List. There is no way to stop Tiny Web except End Task operation.

<h2><a name="SoWhat">What does TinyWeb do</a></h2>


<h3>Handles http-requests!</h3>

<p>Path to home directory is taken from command line as a first parameter. The second parameter is bind-port and the third is bind-address, both are optional, don't use them if unsure.

The default directory root file name is <code>index.html</code>. Make sure that <code>index.html</code> exists in the directory first command line paramenter points to. Please refer to <code>error_log</code> in case of any troubles. The only <code>GET</code>, <code>HEAD</code> and <code>POST</code> commands are handled.


<h3>Executes CGI applicaions!</h3>

<p>The following environment variables are passed to application:

<code>
<ul>
<li>REMOTE_HOST
<li>REMOTE_ADDR
<li>GATEWAY_INTERFACE
<li>SCRIPT_NAME
<li>REQUEST_METHOD
<li>HTTP_ACCEPT
<li>HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET
<li>HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING
<li>HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE
<li>HTTP_FROM
<li>HTTP_HOST
<li>HTTP_REFERER
<li>HTTP_USER_AGENT
<li>QUERY_STRING
<li>SERVER_SOFTWARE
<li>SERVER_NAME
<li>SERVER_PROTOCOL
<li>SERVER_PORT
<li>CONTENT_TYPE
<li>CONTENT_LENGTH
</ul>
</code>

<p>To learn more about CGI, please visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/</a>.
<p>CGI interface was tested with Perl5 for NT, which is available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://www.activestate.com/">http://www.activestate.com/</a>
<p>CGI application are being executed from /cgi-bin/ directory only.
<p>The samples to test CGI are provided in <code>cgitest.zip</code> package within TinyWeb archive.            
<p>Note that TinyWeb extracts content-types, associated to file extensions, and script interpreters (e.g. Perl) form Windows Registry, so make sure that <code>.html</code>, <code>.htm</code>, <code>.pl</code> are registered file types. It means that I recommend to use <code>.pl</code> as an extension for CGI-scripts written in Perl. 
<p>The information is being taken from registry (to TinyWeb's cache) on TinyWeb's startup, so if you made some content-type or file-assotiation-related changes of registry, you must reload TinyWeb in order to take effect.

<h3>Keeps logs!</h3>
<p>TinyWeb keeps Apache-compatible <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://www.w3.org/Daemon/User/Config/Logging.html#common-logfile-format">The Common Logfile Format</a> log files: <code>access_log</code>, <code>agent_log</code>, <code>referer_log</code> and <code>error_log</code>, which can be analyzed by any compatible log analyzer, eg:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/">Analog</a> (author's choice!)
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/websoft/wwwstat/">WWWstat</a>

<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic/">WebReport</a>
</ul>
<p>If some of them do not do what you want, let me know! You can also try some of the other log analysis tools. Consult the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Software/Internet/World_Wide_Web/Servers/Log_Analysis_Tools/">Yahoo guide</a> for a list.
<p>Logs are kept in a derectory from that TinyWeb was started. Make sure that "Start In" directory of TinyWeb properties is set properly.
<p>Please note that TinyWeb doesn't support <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile.html">W3C's Extended Log File Format</a>.

<p>We do run TinySSL on a secure server certified by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://www.thawte.com/">Thawte</a> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/https://support.ritlabs.com/">https://support.ritlabs.com/</a>

<h3>Installing a Secure Socket Layer Server using TinySSL</h3>
<p>In order to initiatine a SSL-connection, the secure server must have a certificate or, in other words, Digital ID (there is a good <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://digitalid.verisign.com/ask_veri.htm">Information Desk</a> on that at Verisign and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/newfaq/">FAQ on Cryptography</a> at RSA). The client can (and probably should) have a certificate. TinySSL does not currently provide client-certificate verifications.
<p>First of all, you must generate your secure server's RSA private key. For that, feed <code>.rnd</code> file with lots of interesting and varied data, that would be used for key generation. <code>.rnd</code> is unformatted file, size don't care. You can copy a wav-file with digitized noize to it, or just a text-file with randomly-typed words and phrases.
<p>To generate a key, type:
<pre>
ssleay genrsa -rand .rnd -out key.pem 1024
</pre>

<p>This command sequence will generate a 1024-bit RSA private key and store it in the file <code>key.pem</code>.  The key should look like:

<font size="-1">
<pre>
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIBOwIBAAJBALtv55QyzG6i2PlwZ1pah7++Gv8L5j6Hnyr/uTZE1NLG0ABDDexm
q/R4KedLjFEIYjocDui+IXs62NNtXrT8odkCAwEAAQJAbwXq0vJ/+uyEvsNgxLko
nWmM1KvqnAo5uQIhALqEADu5U1Wvt8UN8UDGBRPQulHWNycuNV45d3nnskWPAiAw
ueTyr6WsZ5+SD8g/Hy3xuvF3nPmJRH+rwvVihlcFOg==
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
</pre>
</font>

<p>Remember, that your secure server certificate (Digital ID) will be useless without the key. 

<h3>Obtaining a certificate (Digital ID) for secure server</h3>

<p>Then you should generate your Certificate Signing Request (CSR). 
The CSR is what contains the name information for the certificate (Country, State/Province, City, Organization, Division, Web Server Domain Name, etc).  
It also contains your public key. 

The formats of certificate and CSR used by TinySSL are the same as for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://www.apache-ssl.org/">Apache-SSL</a>. 
CSR should be sent for verification to Certificate Authority (CA) e.g. to Verisign (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://www.verisign.com/">www.verisign.com</a>) or Thawte (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://www.thawte.com/">www.thawte.com</a>). 

Thawte has issued a certificate for TinySSL without any problem, we use it at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/https://support.ritlabs.com/">https://support.ritlabs.com/</a>.
Verisign are now signing certificate requests for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://www.apache-ssl.org/">Apache-SSL</a>, more details are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://digitalid.verisign.com/server/apacheNotice.htm">online</a>.

After verification you will probably receive the certificate. 
<p>To generate your CSR, run:

<pre>
ssleay req -new -key key.pem -out req.pem -config ssleay.cnf 
</pre>

<p>This command sequence will prompt you for the attributes of your certificate.
Remember to give the secure server domain name when you would be prompted for "Common Name".

<p>The request should look like:

<font size="-1">
<pre>
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
MIIBGzCBxgIBADBjMQswCQYDVQQGEwJBVTETMBEGA1UECBMKUXVlZW5zbGFuZDEa
MBgGA1UEChMRQ3J5cHRTb2Z0IFB0eSBMdGQxIzAhBgNVBAMTGkNsaWVudCB0ZXN0
2NNtXrT8odkCAwEAATANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQQFAANBAC5JBTeji7RosqMaUIDzIW13
oO6+kPhx9fXSpMFHIsY3aH92Milkov/2A4SuZTcnv/P6+8klmS0EaiUKcRzak4E=
-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
</pre>
</font>

<p>You will now have a private key in <code>key.pem</code> and a CSR in <code>req.pem</code>
<p>Make sure to store <code>key.pem</code> in a safe place. You will need the key to operate your secure server when CA issue your certificate. Note, that it is very important to backup the private key that corresponds to the certificate you                             purchased. Without the private key the certificate is quite useless. For good security reasons the most of CA's are unable to reissue certificates arbitrarily if you cannot access your private key!
<p>Then send <code>req.pem</code> to CA.
<p>Upon reception of a signed certificate from CA, put it to cert.pem.
<p>The certificate should look like:

<font size="-1">
<pre>
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----                                     
MIICLjCCAZcCAQEwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEEBQAwWzELMAkGA1UEBhMCQVUxEzARBgNV

8lwwNd4NP+OE3NzUNkCfh4DnFfg9WHkXUlD5UpxNRJ4gJA==                
-----END CERTIFICATE-----                                       
</pre>
</font>

<p>You can also generate a temporary but ready to use untrusted test certificate by running:

<pre>
ssleay req -new -key key.pem -out cert.pem -x509 -config ssleay.cnf 
</pre>

<p>There is also a good temporary untrusted test certificate generator at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205052436/http://www.cryptsoft.com/~tjh/usercert.cgi">http://www.cryptsoft.com/~tjh/usercert.cgi</a>.

<li>I reffered your Tiny to a friend, and he had it set up in 4 min. It is a very good program. <i>&lt;Bryan Turner&gt;</i><p>
<li>I just wanted to thank you for providing this web server free of charge. I downloaded about 7 web servers off of "windows95.com" and all of them were made by big companies and stuff and none of them worked as good as yours.  I wanted another one just so I could have SSI, but after installing 7 of the others and none of them working as good or as simple as yours, I decided to stick with tinyweb.  Anyway, thanks for a great, no-hassle web server. <i>&lt;Jay Olive&gt;</i><p>
<li>Thanks for sharing your engineering talent with those of us who are C++ challenged :-) <i>&lt;Ken Hopper&gt;</i><p>
<li>A web server in 40K!? Wow, I am impressed with TinyWeb. Sure, it isn't exactly the most full featured web server that you can download, but it sure is the smallest! The thing I like about it is that it has a very small memory footprint, and it works. Very neat indeed. <i>&lt;Evan Jones&gt;</i><p>
<li>I'm just moving into Delphi &amp; Winsock programming in a serious way (Lots of coding experience but new to these two environments). You're TinyWeb source code should be great for learning/experimenting! <i>&lt;Andy Frankford&gt;</i><p>
<li>Cool program! Nice to see other people who want a simple server without soo much bloat! <i>&lt;Bruce Orcutt&gt;</i><p>
<li>The Concept is excellent. I'm already running WinGate, which is a proxy server for intranets to allow each workstation on to the internet. All I wanted was a little http server to serve my actual home page, but I needed CGI. With all of the other servers, if they had CGI, then they usually also came with FTP, smtp, pop3, and so much other stuff. I did not want to do a lot of setting up, and I did not want anything but http. TinyWeb filled this gap nicely. It is incredibly easy to install, and integrates well with other things on your computer, not taking it over. And it was surprisingly easy to get perl to work.<i>&lt;Kim Saunders&gt;</i><p>
<li>TinyWEB is pretty cool. I liked how it runned in the backround. I also run another program, though, for my domain name (which I got at http://www.ml.org) to work right, because I have a static IP. Still, I like TinyWEB because when somebody goes to your site, they don't need to go trough a server handling hundreds of requests. It goes directly to your site. Also, you won't need to upload files, because there already on your site! TinyWEB is a cool program. <i>&lt;Chance Original&gt;</i><p>
<li>You know it already, but I have to say it once more: Your "tinyweb" is an excellent little web server, very very easy to install and.. well.. it works... ;) And the best: it's freeware and the sources are also free... I am a delphi programmer, and I am surprised how compact the program is... I don't know if we'll ever need a web-server in our projects, but if, it will surely be based on tinyweb... Once more: thank you.. <i>&lt;Juergen Witte&gt;</i><p>
<li>Thanks for developing and sharing Tiny Web! It is one of the best basic Web servers to have come along to date, and NOBODY can argue about it's size, performance and low impact on the host system.  I have found absolutely NOTHING to complain about in Tiny Web. <i>&lt;Bill Powell&gt;</i><p>
<li>I must congratulate you on your excellent web server program (TinyWeb), this is a great bit of code and I have found it perfect for creating a small, quick and easy web server.<i>&lt;Wayne Haigh&gt;</i><p>
<li>I am so impressed with TinyWeb. Awsome coding!! I enjoyed reading the code. Prof looking! Lol. It just worked. I unzip it and ran it. It it just works. Wild!!!! heh. Very rar with server programs. :-) <i>&lt;Jonas E. Hjortlund&gt;</i><p>
